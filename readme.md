## Description

Overlap requires users to put multiple shapes together to form a shape that matches the model object given to them. Users can overlap the shapes to make some areas disappear.

## MVP:

- User can move the shapes and overlap them. The areas with an even number of layers will disappear.
- User can rotate the shapes.
- End the round when the user achieves the model object.
- Implement timer, automatically set to zero when entering a new round.
